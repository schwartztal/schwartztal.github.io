How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Wireframing as a pair was more enjoyable than wireframing by myself. As the driver I got some good pointers and feedback from the navigator and we both shared our existing personal site wireframes to get ideas from each other before diving in to our blog template wireframes. Fortunately we had similiar approaches to the sites so we were able to build off of those ideas together.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Wireframing was super helpful when it came time to write the HTML for the blog template, I just pulled up the wireframe on one monitor and wrote the HTML tags and content (?) for each of the elements that I could see on the screen. Once each one was represented my first pass of the HTML was complete. I think this back and forth iterative approach makes building the site much more palatable by breaking it up into easy to complete chunks with quick feedback cycles of "hey that worked!". 

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We decided that for this stage of the process a good wireframe is as simple a representation as possible of the site that still gets across the basic pieces of the pages, where images or textboxes will live, the purpose of each, and some logical groupings for HTML sections. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
	Nothing new for this particular exercise but we did spend some time talking about the semantic elements for HTML5 and where/when to use article vs main vs section, etc. We had a good discussion but couldn't really come to many conclusions since we don't know much about how the semantic elements are used elsewhere. In the context of just building an HTML page that displays correctly they are all interchangeable, so clearly there's a reason that's determined by some other uses of the tags. Looking forward to learning more about that in the future
