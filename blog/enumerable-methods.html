	<title> <h1> Enumerable#Map </h1></title>
		<h4>A quick how to for the #map method for enumerables</h4>
<p>
The enumerable methods provide for an easy way to interact with and modify (if desired) a collection of elements. In this post we'll be looking at the #map method which goes through each element of the collection, executes some logic and returns the output into a new collection.</p>

<p>The map method runs through each element in the collection and returns the results of running block with obj passed in. It is a non-destructive method which does not alter the element on which it was called. The syntax for map is: </p>
<code> map { |obj| block } --> array </code>

<p> For example, if we have an array <i>a</i> and want to add 1 to each of the elements in that array and call it b we could use map as such: </p>
<code>
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = a.map{|x| x + 1}
  => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
p a
  => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code>

<p>We could also use map to modify the elements if they are strings, like making everything lowercase</p>
<code>
  names = ["Bob", "Harry", "Sally", "SARAH"]
  lowercase_names = names.map{|x| x.downcase}
    => ["bob", "harry", "sally", "sarah"]
</code>

<p>So far, map is looking a lot like a loop through the collection using <i>.each</i>. And in fact all of the Enumerator methods that loop through the collection are based on #each. The benefit of map is that it returns the output in a new collection and so doesn't need to be initalized with an empty collection to receive changes. This can be quite useful in writing clear and conside re-factored code when chaining the map operation with other methods.</p>

<h4> Don't forget about #map 's destructive little brother: #map!</h4>
<p>So far we've only looked at .map which returns a whole new collection modified by the provided block. Sometimes though you DO want to change the underlying collection and that's where .map! comes in.</p>

<code>
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 a.map!{|x| x + 1}
  => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  p a
  => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code>
