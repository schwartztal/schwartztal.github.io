		<title> Looping in Javascript and Ruby</title>
    <h1> Loop de Loop </h1>
    <h4> comparing simple iterators in Javscript and Ruby</h4>

<p> Creating a loop to iterate through a collection of items (array, hash, letters in a string, etc) is concept that we've explored thoroughly over the first 7 weeks of DBC. Many of our challenges have relied on the ability to create some logic that evaluates or changes each of the items in a collection based on a defined set of rules. Here's an example from last week's Ruby challenge to evaluate whether a credit card number is valid based on the Luhn algorithm where we iterate through each digit in an array called split_digits and add the value of each digit to an instance variable @sum </p><br>

<code>@split_digits.each{|x| @sum +=x}</code><br>

<p> simple as can be right? With Ruby we have the advantage of the built-in Enumerable module which is included for Arrays and gives us the magic behind .each to use whenever wanted.</p>

<p> Javascript requries that we spell out exactly how the loop is constructed and intended to run because it does not have anything analogous to the Enumerable module out of the box*. Looking at the same line of code as above if it were written in Javascript:</p>

<code> for (i = 0; i < splitDigits.length; i++) {<br>
  sum += splitDigits[i];<br>
}</code><br>

<p> not hugely more complicated in this simple example but you can see that each time we want to loop in Javascript we must define the basic building blocks of an iterator. Let's take a look at this construct for Javascript and Ruby.  </p>

<p>Javascript:</p>
<ul>
  <li> a counter: i</li>
  <li> a condition to evaluate:  counter < length of splitDigits </li>
  <li> an iterator: i++ </li>
</ul>

<p>Ruby:</p>
<ul>
  <li> a counter: implicit in .each </li>
  <li> a condition to evaluate:  length of the object --> implicit in .each </li>
  <li> an iterator: implicit in .each </li>
</ul>

<p> Ruby seems like the clear winner here. The entire definition of the loop is implicit in the method .each. One positive point for Javascript is the syntax is the statement which is being iterated is a little bit clearer to read. Compare <i>splitDigits[i]</i> (Javascript) to <i>x</i> (Ruby). In JS because we are explicitly defining the counter and have access to the counter variable i as we iterate, we use the counter as the index position of interest in the variable splitDigits. In Ruby we must define a new variable x which holds the output of the split_digits index i, and only then can we use that value. </p>


<p>* one footnote to this blog post is that comparing looping in Javascript and Ruby is a little bit like comparing apples and oranges. Ruby has the advantage of being a more modern language with a focus on object oriented programming while Javascript is much older, used more widely and must be supported in many legacy browsers so extended functionality can be slow in coming. This gap is somewhat addressed through extensions to Javascript like jQuery which brings very similiar functionality as Ruby by adding an Enumerable method: <a href="https://api.jquery.com/each/"> jQuery .each()</a></p>
