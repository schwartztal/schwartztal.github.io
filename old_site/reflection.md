*What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
	I learned how to use padding/border/margin (not to mention border-radius) to easily and quickly create buttons that have the look and feel that I wanted. This was a substantial improvement over my original plan of using images for each button as I let the browser handle rendering the button and can add or remove buttons with a line of code instead of having to create a new button, upload the image and then link it. 
	I found margin particularly useful for spacing between buttons (at the header and footer of the page) though this doesn't work so well when the browser screen is re-sized to be much smaller (like a mobile device). 

*What did you learn about CSS positioning?
	Two steps forward and one step back in the learning about positioning. I found a clever trick in using the positioning of a container with no content (the header class i defined) to help lay out elements which I wanted to start with an offset from the left edge of the page. 

*What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
	The easiest to implement elements of my design were the header and footer which span the entire page and contain the links to other parts of the site. Creating buttons for the links in the header and footer was also pretty straightforward once I abandoned the idea of having the buttons themselves be images and instead styled with CSS to get the desired look. 
	Most difficult and still not really solved to my satisfaction is the positioning within the header of the image and links relative to each other. By setting a fixed position and forcing everything to be where I wanted it to, it looks visually correct in the default browser size but feels like a hack and doesn't really get the spirit of what I wanted with positioning where there is a relation between the image, buttons and the page and these interact when positioning. 

*What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
	It's tough, especially for me. There are clearly interactions of components of elements that I don't understand very well and the entire topic of positioning is still quite murky.
